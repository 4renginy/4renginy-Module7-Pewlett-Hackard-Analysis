Pewlet Hacker is a large company with several thousands of employees. Baby-boomers are coming to retirment age and PH is getting ready to see, how many employees will be eligable to retire, what would be their compensations, which postions need to be filled when the retirment tsunami starts and what kind of training we will need to provide for the new comers.<br>

* Since we will have such a short of mentors within the company we will need to create some kind of programs or resources for the new employees.

## Summary,
 
There will be 90,398 eligable employees to retire alltogether however some of them already left the company so the retirment numbers with current employees is 72,458. 
Senior Engineers are the ones retiring the most follwed by senior staff members however the qualifed mentor memeber counts are very low. Please see below chart.

<br>
In order to keep up with huge flood of retirments we will not have enough mentors for the newcomers. We will need to create some programs in place to make sure newcomers are successful.
